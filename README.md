# apm_5334
Functions based off of algorithms presented in "Numerical Analysis" (Burden et al.) for my "Applied Numerical Methods: Matrix Methods" course in Winter 2022.

The code is not optimized due to the fast paced nature of the course.

Code for my APM 5333 "Numerical Methods" course for Fall 2021 can be found at https://github.com/benCd/apm_5333
