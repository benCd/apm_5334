# APM 5334 - Applied Numerical Methods: Matrix Methods
Functions based off of algorithms presented in "Numerical Analysis" (Burden et al.) for the "Applied Numerical Methods: Matrix Methods" course I took in Winter 2022.

The code is not optimized due to the fast paced nature of the course.

Code for my APM 5333 "Numerical Methods" course for Fall 2021 can be found at https://github.com/benCd/apm_5333
